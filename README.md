# edpy
An implementation of the **ed** line editor in Python.

```
$ ed
Welcome to edpy!

```


## What is ed?
*ed* is the [original line editor for UNIX][0], written by Ken Thompson circa
1971. Itself influenced by qed, ed is the precursor to modern modal editors:
among it's descendants are ex, sed, vi, and vim. ed was one of the core
components of the UNIX system, and as such is a historically important piece
of software.

It is also awful to work with.

## Why remake ed?
Although it's a pain, ed is just _cool_; masochistic programming is in vogue.

It's also a neat little project to do: probably the easiest editor out there
to write up, and it'll be fun. Besides, it's always a good idea to brush up on
Python.

## Anything else?
I'll be adding more to the README as the project becomes more fleshed out.

Please, feel free to fork and make PRs if you want in on this.

_Also let me know if you've got a better name._
